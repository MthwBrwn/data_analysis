Using the same API (IEXTrading.com) that you consumed in your Stock API application, make an initial API call for 5 years of time series data for any major company that youâ€™d like to work with. Some potential opportunities would be Microsoft, Google, Apple, or Amazon.

Whatever company your choose must have at least five years of data available to work with.

Load the data you receive into a Pandas DataFrame

Show the first five rows of the data set

Show the description and the info of the data set

Ensure that the date column has been cast into a datetime object in your DataFrame

Using a regression model, split your data into train and test data

Fit your training split to the regression model

Draw at least three conclusions from your regression model
